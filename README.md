## Project Descriptions
### 1. Combinational Circuit (An Arbitrary Example)
A combinational circuit with different concurrent signal assignment techniques. VDHL description of this truth table given below.

### 2. 4-bit ALU
An Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU) is a combinational circuit that performs logical and arithmetic operations on a pair of n-bit operands (in this case, A[3:0] and B[3:0]). The operations performed by an ALU are controlled by a set of operation-select inputs. In this work, 4-bit ALU has 3 operation-select inputs, S[2:0]. Logical operations take place on the bits that comprise a value (known as bitwise operations), while arithmetic operations treat inputs and outputs as twoâ€™s complement integers.

The block diagram and the truth table for the ALU are shown below.

### 3. Sequential Design - Digital Clock
A 32-bit up_down counter with a synchronous reset and an enable input. In up mode, counter will count up to until "upperlimit" and then reset to zero. In down mode, counter will count down to zero and then reset to "upperlimit".

### 4. Sequential Design - Rotating Squares
This project implements the rotating squares on seven segments as shown in this figure:

### 5. Finite State Machine - Sequence Detector (1101)
### 6. Finite State Machine - Vending Machine
### 7. Finite State Machine with Datapath - Iterative Divider
